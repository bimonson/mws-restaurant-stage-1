#### _Three Stage Course Material Project - Restaurant Reviews_

## Project Overview: Stage 1

This code completes the requirements outlined in **Stage One** of the **Restaurant Reviews** web application.
The following features were implemented as outlined in the project rubric:

* The site UI is compatible with a range of display sizes
* Images are responsive
* Elements are visible and usuable in all viewports
* Images are accessible
* Focus allows for easy navigation of the site
* Site elements are defined semantically
* Pages that have been visited are available offline

### View web app

1. In this folder, start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer. Python has some simple tools to do this, and you don't even need to know Python. For most people, it's already installed on your computer.

In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.

2. With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000`

3. Use Chrome Dev Tools to test offline availability
